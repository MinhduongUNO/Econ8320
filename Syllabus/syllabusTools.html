<li><p>The course will cover basic principles of programming languages, as well as libraries useful in collecting, cleaning and analyzing data in order to answer research questions. The course will utilize basic Economic principles and Econometric methods as inspiration for assignments and projects throughout the duration of the course, and will do so in a way that is accessible to non-Economists. This course is intended to introduce the student to the Python programming language as a tool for conducting data analysis. While the course uses Python, the student should be able to move to other languages frequently used in data analysis using the principles taught in this course.</p></li>

<li><p>UNO’s requirements for Academic Integrity and Behavior All students are required to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity and behavior and must satisfy the UNO Academic Integrity Policy <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/academic-integrity.php">www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/academic-integrity.php</a> and Student Code of Conduct <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/code-of-conduct.php">www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/code-of-conduct.php</a>. It is the student’s responsibility to read, understand and abide by these policies. If I find that you have plagiarized, been dishonest in completing your assignments, or cheated an an exam or assignment, then I reserve the right to award you no points on the entire exam, project, or assignment and to report the behavior to the university. If this behavior is repeated, I reserve the right to award a failing grade, independent of your score on other assignments. Academic integrity is essential to education, and I take it very seriously.</p>
